This is a Work in Progress project.

The aim of it is to build a self driving car through image processing and a Neural Network, able to race a full track in Project Cars 1 (to be tested its capacities in other racing games in the future).
This project has been based in the GTA V self driving car guide made by Sentdex (link [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/)).
